# shlok (‡§∂‡•ç‡§≤‡•ã‡§ï): dependently typed functional language

The project is in its nascent stage. I am currently learning to write, type checker for simply-typed lambda calculus (STLC) üöß

Here are few things I am looking to build:

### Highlights of this project

- Smallest imaginable statically typed functional language
- Dependent type sytem serves as the core of the language
- Evolved from a small STLC core to dependent-typed lambda calculus
- Support for data types and writing simple programs in its initial version

### Reading material

##### Simply typed lambda calculus

- Paper on "An Implementation of a Dependently Typed Lambda Calculus" by Andres L√∂h, Conor McBride and Wouter Swierstra
- OPLSS 2018 lectures "Foundations of Programming Languagues" by Paul Downen and Jan Hoffman
- Chapter 7 on Types, "Essentials of Programming Languages" 3rd edition by Daniel P. Friedman and Mitchell Wand
- Part II on Simple Types, "Types and Programming Languages" by Benjamin C. Pierce
