# shlok (‡§∂‡•ç‡§≤‡•ã‡§ï): Dependently Typed Functional Language

The project is in its nascent stage. I am currently learning to write, type checker for simply-typed lambda calculus (STLC) üöß

Here are few things I am looking to build:

### Highlights of this project

- Smallest imaginable statically typed functional language
- Dependent type sytem serves as the core of the language
- Evolved from a small STLC core to dependent-typed lambda calculus
- Support for data types and writing simple programs in its initial version

### Reading material
